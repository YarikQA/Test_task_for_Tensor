# Test_task_for_Tensor
Some autotests for Yandex (Selenium, Pytest).

Did this with PageObject pattern.

For running my tests:

1) Download files from this repository
2) Install all files from requirements.txt(pip install -r requirements.txt) in your shell
3) Write in your terminal: "pytest -s -v test_yandex_search_and_images.py" (without quotes ofc)
4) Enjoy!

I'm gonna be so Thankful for your feedback!
